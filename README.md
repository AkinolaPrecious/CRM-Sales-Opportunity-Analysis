Dataset info: 
The dataset provides information on the prospective accounts(companies), Products, Sales team and the Sales Pipeline of a Hypothetical company. We can track meetings with companies, record of the deal stage and close value. 
The sales manager can access reliable information about the progress of individual team members in achieving their sales target, assess deal viability which enables them manage sales pipeline and all individual milestones from gaining the interest of potential customers through to closing a deal or otherwise and provide teams with real-time update. 
Sales Reps also get a deeper understanding of their clients, and the opportunity to spend more time developing the best strategy required to close a deal.

such as enhancing sales channels to increase revenue, pinpointing underperforming products, sectors and accounts that may require attention or discontinuation of a deal,
and assessing sales team performance to identify regions and Sales Reps with high or low sales.
